# `mosmicrosim`: mosquito microclimate simulator 

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

A prototype R package for simulating a timeseries of microclimatic conditions - e.g. local water surface area, water and air temperature and humidity - in a given location on earth, for a mosquito species, given a simple set of assumptions about the species' habitat preferences.

Most of the computational work is done by the [NicheMapR R package](https://mrke.github.io/) and its internal Fortran routines for physical simulation of microclimate conditions. This package provides a simplified interface for specifying mosquito habitat types, linking NicheMapR to custom spatial climate/weather data, and including some additional simulation models for different types of small water bodies.

So far the package does nothing. The to do list is as follows:

 - [x] Import NicheMapR and set up package
 - [ ] Write a shim for functions like `NicheMapR::microclimate()` to enable incorporation of other sources of climate timeseries data
 - [ ] Streamline simulation of microclimate components not including local water surface area, and water and air temperature, and humidity
 - [ ] Implement simulation of local water surface area, and water and air temperature, and humidity using a set of water body models (cone, cylinder, with/without leakage)
 - [ ] Write a simplified interface to simulating microclimatic conditions based on different mosquito habitat assumptions
